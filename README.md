# Fitapp
Hack the North 2021 Submission

## 💡 Inspiration
As students wanting to be inspired by other people's fitness journies, we wanted to create a safe space mirroring popular social media platforms to be used for fitness purposes only. It is easy to be distracted when looking for fitness posts on current popular social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram, so we wanted to create Fitapp, a web application, for users to scroll through infinite sources of inpsiration and knowledge to achieve their own health goals.

## 📜 What it does
Fitapp is a web app where users can upload posts about their fitness experiences using easy, user-friendly templates for different categories. All these posts will then go on the main explore page for everyone to view. Users are able to scroll through their feed for these blog posts about food and nutrition, yogo and meditation, strength training, cardio training, and sports training to get inspired and learn more. A search bar and filters are available on the explore page for users to look for exactly what they need.

## 👣 Challenges we ran into
In the time restriction, we were unable to completely connect the database with the front-end. Therefore, posting blogs and viewing uploaded posts isn't set up yet. But we currently have some placeholder posts on the website to show what it would potentially look like when the database gets properly connected. The search bar and filters are also purely placeholders for the time being, yet they still show what our plans are for the future.

## 🚚 What's next for Fitapp
- connecting db to the web app 
- implementing search bars and filters (catogories, sort by)
- implementing comments, likes, reviews, and save for later functions on posts
- dynamic backgrounds and graphics
- more templates!
